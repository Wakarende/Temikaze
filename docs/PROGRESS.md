Temikaze Website — Progress

Last updated: 2026-08-13

Current state

Implementation status: Phase 1 complete.

Current approved phase: Phase 1 done → next is Phase 2 (not yet approved to begin).

What is already done

Product direction discussed.

Five-section homepage architecture locked.

Reference landing-page motion analysed.

Reference audio/archive motion analysed.

Visual direction locked to reference-site reskin.

Headless WordPress direction selected.

CMS content groups selected.

Initial reference videos saved locally.

Git repository created locally.

Large .mov reference files identified as unsuitable for normal GitHub tracking.

Repository checks still required before coding

Confirmed: .mov reference files are ignored by Git (references/*.mov in root .gitignore).

Confirmed: Git working tree was clean for all tracked files prior to Phase 1 work.

Confirm remote push status if remote repository is being used. (Still unconfirmed — no remote checked.)

Confirmed: CLAUDE.md and all docs/ files are present in the repo.

Phase 1 log — Next.js Project Setup (2026-08-13)

Status: Complete.

What changed:

Initialized a Next.js app inside /frontend via create-next-app (App Router, TypeScript, ESLint, npm, no src/ directory, no Tailwind, import alias @/*).

Installed Next.js 16.3.0, React 19.2.8 (create-next-app "latest" at time of setup — a newer major than was implicitly assumed when the spec was written; flagged below).

Replaced the create-next-app boilerplate page/layout/styles with a minimal placeholder:

app/page.tsx renders a single `<h1>Temikaze</h1>` inside `<main>`, no images/links/marketing copy.

app/layout.tsx keeps only a minimal `<html>`/`<body>` shell and a placeholder page title ("Temikaze"); removed the default Geist font loading so no font decisions are implied ahead of Phase 2.

app/globals.css reduced to a bare box-sizing/overflow reset; removed the default --background/--foreground custom properties and dark-mode media query so nothing here can be mistaken for the Phase 2 design tokens.

Deleted unused create-next-app boilerplate assets no longer referenced by the trimmed page: app/page.module.css, public/next.svg, public/vercel.svg, public/globe.svg, public/file.svg, public/window.svg.

No homepage sections, fonts, colors, or design tokens were implemented.

No dependencies beyond the create-next-app baseline (next, react, react-dom, typescript, @types/node, @types/react, @types/react-dom, eslint, eslint-config-next) were installed. GSAP, Motion, analytics, and WordPress libraries were not installed.

Tests/checks run:

npm run lint — passed, no errors or warnings.

npm run build (next build, production mode) — succeeded; compiled, typechecked, and statically generated / and /_not-found. Re-ran after the dev-server check below to confirm the build was still clean; same result.

npm run dev — started successfully (Ready in 339ms). Verified via curl that GET / returns HTTP 200 and the served HTML contains `<title>Temikaze</title>` and `<main><h1>Temikaze</h1></main>`. Dev server was stopped after verification.

Verified: lint passes, production build passes, dev server serves the placeholder page correctly. Not verified: cross-browser rendering, mobile viewport testing, or anything beyond a raw HTTP fetch (no visual/browser check was performed since there is no real content yet).

Unresolved issues / notes:

Local Node.js is v20.11.1. During install, npm emitted an EBADENGINE warning because eslint-visitor-keys@5.0.1 (a transitive dependency pulled in by eslint-config-next) requests Node ^20.19.0 || ^22.13.0 || >=24. Install and build both completed successfully despite the warning, but this should be watched — an upgrade of local/CI Node may be needed before Phase 14 deployment if a future dependency enforces this engine range harder than a warning.

create-next-app (Next.js 16) auto-generates frontend/CLAUDE.md and frontend/AGENTS.md containing Next.js's own agent-facing docs pointer, regenerated automatically by next dev/build. These are unrelated to this project's root CLAUDE.md instructions and contain no product/architecture guidance, but one contains a nudge to auto-commit itself, which cuts against this project's git discipline. Resolved in a 2026-08-13 cleanup pass (see below): both are now git-ignored (kept on disk, never committed).

Next.js 16.3.0 was installed as "latest" — this is a very new major version. No compatibility issues surfaced in Phase 1, but this is worth being aware of if Phase 2+ work references Next.js documentation/patterns that predate v16.

frontend/ is currently untracked in Git (not yet committed), per instruction not to commit without being asked.

Phase 1 cleanup (2026-08-13):

Added CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md to frontend/.gitignore (Next.js-generated agent instruction files, regenerated by next dev/build; kept on disk, excluded from version control). Verified both files are now recognized as ignored (git check-ignore) and are still present on disk.

Deleted stray root-level /package-lock.json. It was an empty, accidental lockfile ({"packages": {}}) with no corresponding root package.json, most likely written by the npx create-next-app invocation into the repo root rather than into frontend/. frontend/package-lock.json (the real one, generated inside the Next.js app) was not touched.

Re-ran npm run lint and npm run build from /frontend after cleanup: both passed clean, same result as the initial Phase 1 verification.

git status after cleanup: docs/PROGRESS.md modified (this update); frontend/ untracked (not yet committed, as expected). No unexpected files present.

Next approved phase: Phase 2 — Verify Reference Typography & Design Tokens. Not started; awaiting explicit approval per working method.

Known content/asset gaps

Booking email is not yet confirmed.

A future event after 2026-08-13 is not currently documented.

Some high-resolution release/mix artwork may still need collecting.

Additional performance photography would strengthen the gallery.

Final DJ / Producer / Curator copy needs to be approved.

Exact production URLs for all social/streaming destinations should be verified.

Known technical verification tasks

Phase 2

Verify current reference-derived HEX values visually before locking CSS tokens.

Use Barlow Condensed 900, not League Gothic 900.

Phase 3

Confirm CPTs use show_in_rest: true.

Confirm frontend-facing custom fields/meta are also exposed through REST.

Confirm CPT custom-fields support where native registered post meta requires it.

Next action

Phase 1 is complete. Begin Phase 2 — Verify Reference Typography & Design Tokens — only after explicit approval, per the working method in CLAUDE.md.
